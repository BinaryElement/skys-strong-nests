[mod-setting-description]
max-spidertron-tier=The entity's health will increase by this amount.
max-health-multiplier=The entity's health will be multiplied by this amount.  This happens before the addition.
flat-resistance-addition=The entity's flat resistance to all damage types will increase by this amount.  NOTE: See the multiplier version's description
flat-resistance-multiplier=NOT IMPLEMENTED - resistances are completely replaced with the addition value.
percent-resistance-addition=The entity's percentage resistance to all damage types will increase by this amount.  NOTE: See the multiplier version's description
percent-resistance-multiplier=NOT IMPLEMENTED - resistances are completely replaced with the addition value.
percent-resistance-reverse-multiplier=NOT IMPLEMENTED - planned feature: the remainder of vulnerability after percent resistance is further resisted by this percent.  For example, 50% reverse multiplier on an entity with 40% resistance will gain an additional 30% resistance (50% of the remainder of 100%-40%, or 100%-<existing resistance>).  This happens after the standard multiplier.
new-flat-resistance=Types this entity does not already resist will gain this flat resistance against it.
new-percent-resistance=Types this entity does not already resist will gain this percent resistance against it.
health-regeneration-addition=The entity's health regeneration per TICK (60x per second) will increase by this amount.
health-regeneration-multiplier=The entity's health regeneration per TICK (60x per second) will be multiplied by this amount.  This happens before the addition.
health-regeneration-percentage-addition=The entity's health regeneration per TICK (60x per second) will be increased by a value equal to (this number * max health).  For example, setting it to 0.01666666666 (which is 1/60) will make the entity heal its entire health bar over one second.
only-vanilla-entities=Force the mod to use a hardcoded set of entity names to target only vanilla worms/nests.  This is useful for compatibility reasons, such as if you want your worms/nests from Alien Pets to not be buffed.
